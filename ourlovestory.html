                <h6>Our Unexpected Beginning</h6>
                <p class="px-2 py-2 ">It all started in the 9th-grade tuition class—a place where we were simply classmates. Little did we know that this seemingly ordinary setting would be the stage for an extraordinary journey. Our story began with a playful fight at the water tap, where we were more rivals than friends. It was a moment of youthful disagreement that, at the time, seemed like the end of our interactions.

            <h6>From Rivals to Friends</h6>
            <p class="px-2 py-2 ">Fast forward a bit, and our lives took an unexpected turn. Out of the blue, a friend request from him on Snapchat appeared. What started as a casual acceptance quickly turned into more. Our conversations shifted to Instagram, where simple exchanges grew into daily dialogues filled with laughter and shared interests. The transition from being enemies to becoming friends was seamless, and our connection deepened with every message.

        <h6>The Telegram Turn</h6>
        <p class="px-2 py-2 ">As our conversations continued, we moved to Telegram, where our bond became even stronger. We shared our thoughts, dreams, and even our daily experiences. His endearing way of calling me “meri jaan” was both charming and confusing. I played along, pretending not to understand the depth of his feelings, while my own heart was quietly beginning to respond.

        <h6>The Turning Point</h6>
        <p class="px-2 py-2 ">The pivotal moment came when he confided in me about feeling low. When I asked him what he needed, his heartfelt response, “You,” was more than just words—it was a declaration of his feelings. It was at that moment I realized that our bond had evolved from friendship to something much deeper. His vulnerability opened the door to a new chapter in our relationship.

        <h6>From Virtual to Reality</h6>
        <p class="px-2 py-2 ">Our first real-life meeting was at Corona arcade where we could enjoy each other’s company away from the world’s chaos. It was a moment of pure magic—seeing each other’s smiles in person, sharing laughter, and experiencing the joy of being together. Since that day, our relationship has only grown stronger, and our time together has been filled with beautiful memories and countless adventures.

Each day brings new experiences and deepens our connection. As we continue to write our love story, we cherish every moment and look forward to the future with hearts full of hope and happiness.
